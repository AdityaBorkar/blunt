Auto-removal of trailing slashes

trie-based router
Define what server actions must return along with use with middlewares.
export const schema = ... // it will auto-validate the request as per schema.

SSE and Web sockets
Pass schema in Form Component and then use it as TS Reference¬†everywhere
React Query alternative with an inbuilt cache() feature.
TRPC and NextSafeActions alternative with middleware.
Actions can be exported through a single variable.
Note - Middleware only apply to ROUTES and PAGES and not¬†server¬†actions

Output unused packages in the Build Summary.
Also use knip.dev under the¬†hood

- üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Middleware: More built-in middleware for common use cases:
    - CORS handling
    - Rate limiting
    - Request logging
    - Security headers
- Image Optimization: https://bun.sh/docs/api/html-rewriter & https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/images
- Font Optimization: https://bun.sh/docs/api/html-rewriter
- Script Optimization: https://bun.sh/docs/api/html-rewriter
- Partial Prerendering

- Automatic API Documentation:
    - Generate API documentation from the routes from the TS.
    - Works with scalar.com OOTB.
    - Plugin to start Swagger UI for API docs.
- Cache Support. Everything is dynamic by default.
- React Compiler
- Metadata Viewer, Astro-Nextjs Toolbar, Unlighthouse
- Next.js does not automatically block cross-origin requests during development, but will block by default in a future major version of Next.js to - prevent unauthorized requesting of internal assets/endpoints that are available in development mode.
